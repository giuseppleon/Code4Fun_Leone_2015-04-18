Exercise

Suppose you have a folder full of binary files and a class Converter with a BinToTSV method which 

you can pass the name of a binary file to generate a Tab Separated Value file.

Every TSV file has a key on each line and a value next to it spaced with a tab:

num_connections 65

latency_ms 70

bandwidth 20

...

Write a method to calculate the average latency and total bandwidth.
